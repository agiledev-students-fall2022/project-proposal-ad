## What?

It is an automated recipe suggester based on the ingredients you have at home. This software will recognize your food ingredients through a quick snapshot and recommend the food you can cook with what you have.
## Why?

This is convenient for people who struggle to decide or do not know what to cook for their meals.

## For whom?

* Highschool or college students who are living on their own
* Busy workers
* Confused/distressed parents

## How?

1. Users will grab their phones and take a photo of their incredients spread out on a table or in their fridge.
2. The app will scan the incredients.
3. The app will automatically match the ingredients with top-rated recipes from the database.

## Scope

* This app needs to have a handful of recipes with ingredients to sucessfully suggest a meal to the users. Creating a solid database will be challenging as the recipes must cover a variety of cusines.
* Implementing precise image recongnition of the ingredients may be demaning (requires Computer Vision knowledge).
* Implementing a search algorithm that links users' ingredients with potential recipes may be time confusing.
